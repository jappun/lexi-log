I often come across new words while reading online. I look them up but quickly forget them, so I built this Chrome extension to save words along with their definitions and personal notes.

### ▶️ Running Locally
1. Sign up for a free API key from [Wordnik](https://wordnik.com/).
2. Set the API_KEY variable at the top of the app.js to your API key value
3. Upload the extension to Chrome by followin [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)
4. Start expanding your vocabulary

### ⚠️ Protect your API key
If you upload according to my instructions above, only you can access the extension. **If you publish to the Chrome store, you will leak your API key**. Bad agents can abuse the key registered to your name. You can request a new key from Wordnik if you accidentally leak yours.

### ✅ Possible Future Features
- [ ] quiz/flashcards made from the words in your dictionary
- [ ] include pronuciation audio
